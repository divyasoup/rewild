        As you walk along the street, you notice that the buildings here have grass and bushes and trees around them. Normally, you would travel at night, but the commotion gave you no choice but to move during the day. You take careful steps, avoiding the sharp objects beneath your paws.

        Itâ€™s hot today, you can tell the summer is waning. You find puddles of water and drink from them gratefully. As you wander around, you realize that the buildings around you are shrinking. They are still wrecked, but their short height is not from that.
