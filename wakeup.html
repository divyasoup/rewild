        You sleep a long time. When you wake up, the sun is still high in the sky. You feel well rested and content. You stretch and check your surroundings vigilantly. You slept a longer amount of time and you donâ€™t know what could have happened while you did. There are still no noises, you would have woken if there was something to worry about. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You tilt your ears around, angling them to hear any noises. You can hear faint scurrying off in the distance and decide that will be your destination.
