        You sleep a long time. When you wake up, the sun is still high in the sky. You feel well rested and content. You stretch and check your surroundings vigilantly. You slept a longer amount of time and you donâ€™t know what could have happened while you did. There are still no noises, you would have woken if there was something to worry about. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You forage the black bins around you, looking for something to eat. Luckily, there is plenty. With the hotness of the sun, though, there are no more puddles around. After eating your fill, you twist your ears around, listening for the faintest of noises. You can hear faint scurrying off in the distance and decide that will be your destination.
