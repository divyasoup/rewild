            <strong><i>Rewild</i> is a web browser game made to explore the relationship between
            interactivity and artwork. </strong>

            <br><br>
            
            Playing as a fox, you explore the dynamics between natural regrowth of life within humans
            structures. The game is highly focused on choices and artwork, choosing to be an experience rather 
            than a "game" or an "artwork" alone.
