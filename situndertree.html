        There is more grass now. Bushes and small trees are consistent. The shaking of the earth woke you up too early, and in your desperation to find somewhere safe, you’d left before you were fully rested. There is shade under the trees and you decide to rest your paws for a while. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As you sit, you grow more tired. With how little noise and movement there has been around you in your travels, resting seems like it would be safe enough. You bark loudly, hopefully scaring off any potential threats. Although you’ve left your territory, you will be going further away soon. Being rested would be vital.
    </p>
    <p>
        You lay out beneath the tree, safely under its safety, and close your eyes for a while.
