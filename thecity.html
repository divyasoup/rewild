        You are a fox. Up until recently, you lived in a city with lots of loud noises and loud humans. You stayed hidden most of the time. Recently, the ground shook and you hid underneath a large structure until it ended. When you went outside, it was silent.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        There was no humans around, not that you could see, so you decided to go try to find some scraps to eat. Overturned bins supply you with a large amount of food every week, enough that you can live off a meager diet of rats and mice, when there is nothing else.
    </p> 

    <p>
        The silence is eerie to you, it unsettles you. You eat quickly and leave the area, hoping to find any noise.
