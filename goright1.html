    <h2>Go Right</h2>

    <p>	
        You head towards the area where the buildings get shorter and smaller. As you trot along, you notice that the paths are messier than normal. There are lots of fallen over trash cans and you rifle through them for some more food. You keep an eye out, in the past there have been other animals and even people who have chased you away. <strong>No one is there now.</strong>
